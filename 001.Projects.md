# JIRA PROJECTS

 

The "project" is JIRA's *highest level* container.

> Think of it as a table in a database.

A single Jira issue can only exist in one Jira project at a time.

 

### Put all of your team's work into a single JIRA Project

Don't get too caught up in the actual definition of the word Project.

Don't let the semantics of that word lure you into scattering your team's work into a million different fragments.

 

We'll use some of the other attributes of Jira to allow you to divide it up into contextual views.

 

## TYPES of AGILE

*Dan Chuparkoff*

 

### Kanban Agile

is best for teams that are working on bugs or issues where most have an **ASAP Delivery** schedule.

There is a focus on **rapid assignment** and **working in the right order** not as much on estimating projected completion dates for every piece of work.

 

Ideal for support tream or operation teams where the majority of your work comes from customer-submitted issues or tickets.

 

In cases like this, teams **collect all the work that needs to be done**, they **put the work in the right order**, and they **assign it and complete the work as fast as the can**.

 

### Scrum

is best for teams that are working on new features **with a tight schedule for finishing their work** as they try to align with a projected launch target or the coordination with delivery from other teams.

 

Scrum teams manage their way toward this target by breaking their work up into **iterative batches that we call Sprints**.

Most high-performing teams agree that 2 weeks is a good length of time for Sprints.

 

Imagine you are working on a software team implementing new features. In this case, a large amount of your work is defined in a Backlog near the beginning of the project and you're most likely working toward an incremental milestone or the ultimate projected launch date. Your team will still encounter unknowns and you will, of course, still learn new things along the way. So it's normal, acceptable, and even encouraged to refine and redefine some of your work as you proceed. But an important distinction here is that when new work is discovered in the middle of an active Sprint, the existing in-progress work is left to proceed as it is and that **new work is added to the next Sprint**. Because you're Agile, that next Sprint should be right around the corner. (Hence the 2 weeks Sprint)

 

So to summarize: in Scrum, teams **collect all the work that needs to be done**, they **put the work in the right order**, they **define checkpoints for completion of batches of that work**, and then they **reprioritize at each checkpoint**.
