# Small Manageable Snippets : Issues

 

In all kinds of Agile, teams break their to-dos down into small manageable snippets. This breaking of work into fragments helps to ensure that **ownership** of every task **is clear** and that **teams can reprioritize** as **often** as their world changes around them. It also helps to ensure that the work can be delivered to customers and stakeholders as quickly and as often as possible.

 

If your team is new to Agile methodologies, **breaking tasks down** is the most important thing to try first. This **rapid, iterative delivery** of progress is the thing that makes teams **Agile** in the first place.

 

## ISSUES = TICKETS

 

When referrring to all the bits of work in this system, JIRA uses the word, **'issues'**. When I refer to a collection of issues in JIRA, I often say **'tickets'** instead. Because issues sounds like something's broken and this often isn't the case.

 

## Keep it simple

 

As you learn to customize your JIRA experience, remember to keep it simple. **Limit the number of required fields** on your Create Issue screen to the smallest number possible.

 

If you really want to improve visibility to the things your team is juggling then you want logging work, so that it doesn't slip through the cracks, to be quick and easy.

**Logging work should be quick and easy.**

 

 

## Granular tasks

Creating issues is simple. Figuring out what to put in them is a little trickier. When you break work down into tasks, try to break your work into **small enough fragments** that you can **reprioritize** as **often** as you have new ideas and discover new things that need to be done.

 

The right size for your team will depend on the maturity of your project and the length of time between delivery checkpoints. But many Agile teams find that the following rules are good upper and lower targets to aim for.

 

1. **a single Agile task should take you at least a few hours to complete**. This helps to minimize the amount of energy you spend tracking things that are done very, very quickly. This also ensures that the critical and high-priority items aren't lost in a sea of items that don't require as much cross-team visibility.

2. **a single Agile task should not take more than 3 days**. With this as a guideline you can ensure that your team can reprioritize at least twice per week if, and when, you need to. This also helps to make sure that every team member is always less than 72 hours from getting the next thing done.

3. **As you begin to master this, try making the maximum amount of time for a task 1 day to complete**. That way, in every single Stand-up meeting your team members will always have the ability to finish the thing that they say they're working on for the day.

 

## Issue Types

 

The options are Stories, Tasks, and Bugs. Epics is also an Issue Type in that list, but ignore that one for now. It's a special issue type and it behaves a little differently when you choose it. I'll talk about that more in a later section.

 

When you choose Stories, Tasks, and Bugs, aside from changing the icon next to the ossue in all the display screens, this doesn't really affect that much. You can think of these as synonyms.

 

When you want to get a little more granular, you can break it down like this.

 

### Stories

 

**Stories** are usually used by Product Managers to describe planned work for a **specific feature of a product**. For example: "As a user, I need the ability to delete an element in a list." That's a story.

 

### Tasks

 

**Tasks** are typically used by any team members to describe other **planned, non-story work**. Tasks can include literally anything - like: "Create the new database for the Customer Profile Module."

 

### Bugs

 

You can use **Bugs** in order to explicitly call out **unplanned work**. This is helpful when you are trying, as a team, to improve your overall quality. Here's one that I bet some of you have seen before. "The leading zero from Northeast U.S. zip codes is not showing as expected."

 

### Epics

 

In Agile, an **Epic** is a collection of **Stories & Tasks** arranged together to achieve some specific, noteworthy outcome.

 

For example: "Revise the platform user login to incorporate two-factor authentication." or "Add multi-language support for the customer module."

 

In theory, an Epic is a container of tasks and stories. In JIRA, this is mostly true. Sometimes it behaves a little more like a label.

But either way, Epics are important and useful.

 

You can create Epics in JIRA using the **Create Issue** button the same way you create nes stories and tasks.

Once you have a few Epics created, you can add Tasks and Stories to them in the backlog view.

 

**In Scrum planning, it's a good idea to start by defining your Epics at the beginning of a planning session.**

Then, after you prioritize the epics, build out the stories that complete them.

 

If you're following along in your own JIRA, create a few Epics now.

We'll come back to this a little later when we talk about Agile boards in the JIRA backlog.
