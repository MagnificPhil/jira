# CUSTOMIZING ISSUE DETAILS

 

We are ready to dig in a little deeper to the issue details.

 

In addition to the basics, there are few attributes that will come in really handy especially as the list of tickets for your team gets large.

Before we can use them, we need to enable the additional fields on the create issue screen by using the Configure fields button when creating an issue.

 

Let's add Labels and Components, because we are going to talk about sone of their differences next. Let's add also Story Points field that will come in handy later.

 

## Adding Story Points

The **Story Points** field is useful when trying to estimate work during **Scrum planning**.

 

## Dividing the long list

Once you whole team is using JIRA for all of its work, you're going to want a way to start sorting through the long list of tickets.

 

Labels and Components can help. These are both effectively the same things. Labels and Components are just tags applied to issues. Once these tags are here, you can filter on them later in an issue search, with boards, or with quick filters on a board.

 

Although similar, there's one key difference.

 

### Labels

With labels, **users can choose from existing labels or just make their own labels on-the-fly**.

 

For example you could use Labels to differentiate tickets betwwen all your teams. *FrontEndDev vs BackEndDev*

 

### Components

In contrast while existing Components can be added to a ticket by any user with edit privileges,

**`new` Components must be created by an administrator in the settings section for each project.

 

I often use components to help me differentiate between modules within my products. For instance, User Profile Module, Metrics Dashboard Module, Machine Learning Engine, etc.

 

Also when my teams are juggling multiple work on multiple products at the same time, I prefer using Components to allow me to segment the work by product instead of putting their work in different JIRA projects.
