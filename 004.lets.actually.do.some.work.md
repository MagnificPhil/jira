# Let's actually do some work

With what we've discussed so far, you should have everything you need to capture all you work in JIRA.

 

But that's only half the battle. Now we're going to talk about the tools you need to actually do some work.

 

## The scrum backlog

In a scrum project, when you create new JIRA issues, they end up in the **Scrum Backlog** where you can prioritize your team's work and arrange it into **two-week delivery batches** called Sprints.

 

This process is called **Sprint planning** and it's typically done at the beginning of every sprint.

 

You may remember that in Kanban projects, teams tackle the work as it comes in.

> There is no Backlog in Kanban

 

    For Kanban projects, you can jump ahead to the section on Boards.

 

The Scrum Backlog appears at the bottom of your Backlog view in Jira.

You can get to this view once you've selected your project, 13:08
