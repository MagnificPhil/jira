# Let's actually do some work

With what we've discussed so far, you should have everything you need to capture all you work in JIRA.

 

But that's only half the battle. Now we're going to talk about the tools you need to actually do some work.

 

## The scrum backlog

In a scrum project, when you create new JIRA issues, they end up in the **Scrum Backlog** where you can prioritize your team's work and arrange it into **two-week delivery batches** called Sprints.

 

This process is called **Sprint planning** and it's typically done at the beginning of every sprint.

 

You may remember that in Kanban projects, teams tackle the work as it comes in.

> There is no Backlog in Kanban

    For Kanban projects, you can jump ahead to the section on Boards.

## Agile Sprints

As we discussed briefly before in the scrum style of agile teams break their

work up into iterative batches called

sprints this helps teams to set clear

and iterative milestones for their work

it creates clear and controlled

opportunities for teams to pivot and

reprioritize as they learn new things

while at the same time driving the work

toward completion with planning

realistic estimation and firm milestones

a sprint has a start date and an end

date Sprint's are often two weeks long

it's often difficult to complete

substantial features in a single week

and since the team should commit to

completion of the work in a sprint at

its start it's hard to commit to things

at a granular level once you get beyond

two weeks or so also while a spring is

active you shouldn't add new work to the

active sprint instead put new work in

one of the upcoming sprints you create

the next few upcoming sprints on the

backlog view I'm going to do that now

here's a tip since there are 26 two week

periods in a calendar year and also 26

letters of the English alphabet I often

use letters to name my sprints so we can

talk about them as memorable objects

everyone on the team conversationally

will easily be able to say we can't do

this in the f sprint but we should try

to make sure it gets done in the GH or i

sprints when your team wants to make

this a little more fun you can code name

the Sprint's using themed words that

start with sequential letters of the

alphabet like Ferris Bueller Sprint

Gordon Gekko sprint Hal 9000 sprint and

the inigo montoya sprint

although it's really just a tag in JIRA

an epic should be thought of as a

container of stories and tasks with a

clear achievable end ethics are usually

planned on your roadmap which is why

it's really critical that it's clear

when an epic is finished this way you

know if you were successful or not

try to avoid long running unfinish about

ethics like maintenance or refactoring

once you've created some epics using the

create issue screen like we did back in

minute eight of this video those epics

show up in your backlog screen and this

can be very helpful when planning and

prioritizing by default the epics pane

is collapsed but you can open it by

clicking that little tab that says epics

just to the left of the list of sprints

in your backlog the epic pane here on

the JIRA scrum backlog screen allows you

to do three things first

you can drag epics up and down in order

to create clear visual prioritization

for your work I'm going to grab the

production issues from Sprint e epic and

drag it to the top of the list because

those issues outrank any of the others

the others are good like they are for

now

next I mentioned earlier that an epic is

a container of issues now it's time to

fill the container we can use this

screen to quickly and visually drag each

issue from the backlog over into its

respective epoch you can see that as I

do this the backlog gives you a very

colorful look at the balance of work on

your team by epic don't forget each

issue can only be in one epic at a time

finally on the screen once your issues

have been properly assigned the epic

pane in JIRA allows you to easily look

at the issues for one epoch at a time

you can do this simply by clicking the

epic at the left notice that as I select

each epoch the backlog collapses down to

only the issues from that epoch when you

want to see the whole backlog again just

click all issues at the top now that we

have our epics all sorted out it's time

to plan the next sprint open the F

sprint on your backlog and you can see

that it's ready for us to add some

issues a moment ago we prioritize our

ethics so I'm going to grab these yellow

tickets first that way we make sure to

address our highest priority work at the

top of the spring now that I've added

two tickets notice the story point total

at the bottom of the sprint next to the

line that says estimate if you've

already story pointed your issues during

sprint planning as I've done here then

you'll see that the total accumulates as

you add work today we're going to

pretend that in my last 10 sprints I've

learned that my team can get about 15

story points done in a sprint I'm going

to continue to add work until I hit that

number I'll explain that more in a

second this number of story points that

can be done in a sprint is called my

team's velocity once I hit this story

point limit my team is unlikely to get

more work done beyond that so I'm going

to move on to the G sprint next there

I'll continue to add tickets until I hit

my 15-point limit again

notice here in sprint G that I went to

17 points which is a little over my

team's velocity that's okay but there's

a little bit of risk when you do this

get as close as you can and always make

sure the team agrees with the Sprint

commitment I'm going to pause here for a

second to talk about story points in

order to plan the right amount of work

in a sprint it's important to estimate

that work somehow as mere mortals our

ability to estimate hours accurately is

pretty poor

so in agile we estimate work using story

points story points help us to overcome

the inherent uncertainty of estimating

while still creating a useful quantifier

for the items in our backlog story

points are just a relative measure of

complexity

a13 is way harder than a 5 that's it

when estimating an agile assign each

ticket a story point of 1 2 3 5 8 or 13

I skip some of those numbers on purpose

these are the numbers in the fibonacci

sequence in agile Fibonacci numbers are

typically used because when tasks are

small your ability to imagine exactly

what you'll do is fairly accurate when

the estimates are 1 or 2 these are

actually usually somewhere around

proportionately reliable the to really

is twice as hard as the one but as those

tasks get bigger your ability to

estimate exactly perfectly gets worse

and worse your error in estimation

becomes greater and greater and at that

scale the difference between a 12 or 13

or 14 is mostly irrelevant Fibonacci

numbers mapped nicely to this error in

estimation and so that makes it a good

sequence to use for story pointing

there's one more important point if your

team is new at this you'll be pulling

numbers out of the air for a bit if one

person on your team is estimating a

1-day ish thing is 21 points while

others are estimating a 1-day ish thing

as 2 points then your team velocity

won't make any sense at all you've got

to find a way to calibrate if you have

at least one person on your team that is

done story pointing before then use that

person to help your team a line on its

estimates if your whole team is starting

from scratch here though try something

like this heads up

agile aficionados are gonna hate me for

this but I swear it really is useful on

new teams if your whole team is starting

from scratch without an agile expert

then remember this the smallest task or

issue ever should be 2 to 3 hours and

that should be one story goal and your

biggest task or issue

Estimate ever should be three days or 13

story points new teams without an

experienced expert can use these two

fundamental truths to guide their

pointing until they get the hang of it

now that you've prioritize your work and

use story points to figure out what is

realistic for the next two weeks it's

time to start your sprint you can start

your sprint by clicking the start sprint

button at the top right of the backlog

screen just enter a start date and an

end date and the team will be ready to

tackle the next iteration of your work

after the Sprint has been started from

then on you and your team will interact

with the work everyday from the board

whether you're scrum or Kanban the board

in JIRA is the primary screen your team

will use to interact with their work you

can get to the board for your project in

JIRA using that little icon at the left

that looks like a three pane window

agile boards are designed to replicate

the original agile practice of putting

physical index cards on a wall next to

the team on the board in JIRA tickets

are shown as virtual cards and they move

from left to right as they make their

way through the JIRA workflow from to do

in progress to done workflows can be

customized to be infinitely more complex

than this but if you venture into

workflow customization territory try to

make sure that the following things are

always true first all tasks in the

project should go through all the steps

of the workflow and second users should

be able to see all the columns of the

workflow so keep the number of steps to

seven or less a board usually shows a

team tickets in a single project

although it is possible to combine

multiple projects by editing the filter

behind the board and making it more

complex but make sure that a single

person on your team only needs to care

about one project and one board in JIRA

at a time when a person has to straddle

three different boards to get their work

done it's impossible to prioritize

across their pool of work and you'll

quickly find that your will fall out of

sync with what your team is actually

doing

for more on mastering agile and

customizing your JIRA experience to

match the way your team works check out

my other YouTube videos on building

great software with teams teamwork and

collaboration can be hard especially

across offices and time zones but agile

best practices can make it all a little

easier JIRA is the agile choice for some

of the world's greatest technology teams

but even if you're using one of the

other great tools out there asana TFS

Trello monday or one of the others i've

learned that by following some of the

best practices outlined here in this

video your team can be one of the great

ones - that's it for now thanks for
